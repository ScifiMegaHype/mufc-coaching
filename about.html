    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Since Sir Alex retired, supporting United has been an emotional rollercoaster. 
    Our mission is simple: to help fans manage their expectations, avoid heartbreak, 
    and find joy even in tough times.</p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>Our certified psychologists use humor, community, and practical coaching techniques to turn crushing 
    defeats into teachable moments. We’re not miracle workers — but we can help you manage dissapointments, 
    control unrealistic expectations and stay grounded during CL qualification delusion episodes.</p>
